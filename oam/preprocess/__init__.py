    ''' A min-max normalization to all the columns in the dataframe.
    If desired you can change the scale of a given column using the 'weights'
    param. The weight will be multiplied by every value in the column, given it
    more or less importance in the model to be used.
        Args:
            **df** (pandas.DataFrame): The dataframe to be transformed.

            **min** (int): The lower limit of the feature' new range.

            **max** (int): The upper limit of the feature's new range.

            **weights** (dict): Key should be the column name and value
            should be the weight that will multiply it's values.

        Returns:
            (pd.Dataframe): Transformed dataframe.'''
