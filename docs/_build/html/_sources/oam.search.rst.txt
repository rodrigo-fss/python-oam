oam.search
==========

The **search** algorithm will define which dimensions should be compared.
It'll call the score function to evaluate each one of them.

To extend the lib with different search algorithms, just make sure they call the scoring
function with the *score* method.

You can find more details about it in the `repo README <https://github.com/rodrigo-fss/python-oam//>`_!
